Since the previous tutorials we managed to add additional comments to our code to make it easier to read and understand.
Moreover we updated our flowchart and README file.
Additionally we made an overall checkup of code in search of mistakes and possibilites of improvements.
Mateusz Jakubowski – Code checkup, Fixing flowcharts
Tymon Żarski - Updating README, Makefile
